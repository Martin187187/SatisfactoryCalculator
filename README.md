## Introduction

Satisfactory Calculator is a tool designed to assist players of the popular video game "Satisfactory" in optimizing their factory setups.

The game "Satisfactory" challenges players to construct and manage complex automated factories on an alien planet. As players progress, they encounter various resources, machines, and production chains, making the need for efficient calculations crucial to success. Satisfactory Calculator aims to simplify this process and help players make informed decisions when planning their factories.

Note: This program is not designed for user friendly usage. It is just a demo how efficient you could build in Satisfactory. 
The gui is just a test if the graph looks alright and is not a well looking representation of the model.

## Features

- Calculates a extrem optimized production plan for the entire planet with all resources.
- this is a reinforcement learning (machine learning) model
- you can load/save a calculated production plan with "S"
- you can update the graph with "O", zoom with "+" and "-" and move with arrow keys.
- and lastly you can reset the current production graph by pressing "R".
- You can see in the console how many iterations has been passed. The score is the number which has to be maximized. for example 300 means -> 543_632 * 300 = 163089600 points/m
